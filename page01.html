        <p>I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse. &nbsp;When I looked back
          again the second hill had hidden the black smoke. &nbsp;I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a
          loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. &nbsp;I overtook and passed the
          doctor between Woking and Send.</p>
        <h2>Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill</h2>
        <p>The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were
          sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down
          Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. &nbsp;We got to
          Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with
          my cousins and commended my wife to their care.</p>
        <p>My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil. &nbsp;I
          talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the
          utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. &nbsp;Had it not been for
          my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. &nbsp;Would
          that I had! &nbsp;Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.</p>
        <h2>For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day</h2>
        <p>Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood,
          and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night. &nbsp;I was even afraid
          that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars. &nbsp;I can best
          express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death.</p>
        <p>It was nearly eleven when I started to return. &nbsp;The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of
          the lighted passage of my cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day.
          &nbsp;Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. &nbsp;My
          cousins' man lit both lamps. &nbsp;Happily, I knew the road intimately. &nbsp;My wife stood in the light of
          the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. &nbsp;Then abruptly she turned and went in,
          leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.</p>
        <h2>As I came through Ockham</h2>
        <p>I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted
          to the Martians. &nbsp;At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's fighting.
          &nbsp;I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict. &nbsp;As I came through Ockham
          (for that was the way I returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western horizon a
          blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the sky. &nbsp;The driving clouds of the gathering
          thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke.</p>
        <p>Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life; but
          I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with their
          backs to me. &nbsp;They said nothing to me as I passed. &nbsp;I do not know what they knew of the things
          happening beyond the hill, nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or
          deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the night.</p>
